One of the most striking parts that you get drawn to are the reg segments in their lifespan, which represent the years in which they took office. We can see that throughout the years, the overall trend of presidents only 
being elected in their later years persists, and can see see that Joe Biden is actually the latest to be elected into office, nearing starting his term where Ronald Reagon ended his second term. A closer look at the length of 
the red bars easily reveal some interesting things:
- Roosevelt remains the only president to serve 3 terms, and is reflected as a pretty noticeably longer red bar
- Cleveland essentially accomplished what Trump is currently set out to try; get elected, lose the presidency the next term, but then reclaim it the following term

We can also see a lot of president deaths starting from James K. Polk, going to Zachary Taylor, then Abraham Lincoln, then James A. Garfield, then Willam McKinley, Warren G. Harding, and finally ending at John F. Kennedy. Fun 
fact, this occurance is actually called the "Curse of Tippecanoe", and follows the pattern that presidents inaugurated in years divisible by 20 end up dying in office, with Reagon being the next in line. He did end up getting 
shot during office, but died outside of office.
