Shamelessly using them again for another of my reflections; pudding.cool recently published their Februrary article, and analyzed numerous (138 to be exact) performances of the US National Anthem. Page can be found at: https://pudding.cool/2024/02/anthems/.

The National Anthem is broken into each phrase, and each phrase contains the default notes as they were originally written. Scrolling to the bottom additionally shows all the pitch of each performer's rendition stacked on top of each other, and each phrase is ranked by their "devia score". Their examples show key 
differences, with some performers essentially sticking true to the original pitches such as Amber Riley, while performers like Anthony Hamilton at the 2019 NBA All-Star Game practically create their own unique version.

They also sort phrases by their "Diva Score". Once you get past their initial examples, a heatmap with all the singers is presented. It contains all 138 performances separated by the 16 phrases, with a brigter hue representing a greater diva score. Besides being able to play each song and each phrase specifically, 
they also give  you the option to filter by events, artists, or genres. Overall, a really cool comparison, and makes a pretty good visual attempt at how differently each artist can interpret the classical piece.

At the very bottom lists their methodology for converting and normalizing all the sampled performances, and used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to compare phrases.
